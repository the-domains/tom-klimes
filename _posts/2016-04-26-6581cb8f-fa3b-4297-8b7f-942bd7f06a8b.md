HSBC Bank has announced a package of
support for small businesses including access to cheaper finance.

As well as 18 months free banking and lower bank charges, HSBC has launched an online credit eligibility checking tool for small businesses that wish to apply for up to Â£30,000\. This tool should give a decision in less than three minutes.

Ian Stuart, head of UK Commercial Banking for HSBC said that despite uncertainty about the Brexit vote, the bank had not seen a reduction in loan applications so far this year and that the bank approves 89% of the applications it receives.

He added that "SMEs are the lifeblood of
the UK economy and we are committed to providing the finance and support they
need to realise their business goals."
