A YouGov survey of 1,057 businesses
employing 1-2 people questioned
respondents on the everyday barriers that prevented them from growing. These
included:

* Too much time taken up with admin (28 per
cent)
* 
Managing communications with customers (17
per cent)
* 
Traveling to meetings (11 per cent)
* 
Tax/National Insurance (9 per cent)

Overall, lack of time
was cited as a problem for growth by 17 per cent of respondents, while 31 per cent
said they could make more money if they were more productive.

The survey also showed that while 67% wanted to boost productivity, only 33% had a plan for how to do this.

Based on recent UK government business estimates, giving five hours per week back to SMBs could generate an additional Â£23 billion of revenue. 

In the past two years, almost half (46%) of UK businesses have grown, but this figure shows that there's significant room for additional expansion.
